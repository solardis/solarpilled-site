## The SolarPilled Newsletter

### Headline
Solar data and analysis, delivered weekly. No fluff.

### What you get

One email per week with:

- **Policy updates that affect your wallet.** Net metering changes, tax credit updates, tariff impacts. We translate policy into plain language and tell you what it means for your electricity bill.
- **Price and market data.** What panels, batteries, and installations actually cost right now. Trends, not just snapshots.
- **Analysis you can use.** Deep dives on specific topics: financing options compared, battery payback by scenario, state incentive changes. The kind of work that saves you hours of research.
- **Tools and calculators.** First access to new tools we build, plus tips on how to use existing resources effectively.

### What you don't get

- Daily emails
- Thinly veiled sales pitches
- "Top 10 reasons to go solar!" listicles
- Your email address sold to installers

### Who this is for

Homeowners actively researching or planning a solar installation. People who want data, not hype. If you're the type who reads the fine print on a contract before signing, you'll like this newsletter.

### The promise

Every edition is worth your time or we've failed. If an edition doesn't have something genuinely useful, we don't send it. We'd rather skip a week than waste your inbox.
