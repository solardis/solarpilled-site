## What We Do Section

### Header
Solar research, minus the agenda

### Body
Every major solar website makes money by sending you to an installer. That shapes what they tell you.

We publish data-driven guides, calculators, and analysis for homeowners evaluating solar. We tell you when solar makes sense and when it doesn't. We cite our sources. We show our math.

### Three value pillars

**Honest analysis**
We tell you when solar doesn't make sense. No other solar site does this because it conflicts with their business model.

**Real numbers**
Actual panel specs. Real utility rates. Specific payback calculations for your situation. Not "7-10 years" hand-waving.

**Current data**
Solar policy and pricing change fast. Our content reflects what's happening now, not what was true in 2023.
