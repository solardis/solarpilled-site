## About SolarPilled

### The short version

SolarPilled is an independent solar information site for homeowners. We publish guides, analysis, and tools to help you make a smart decision about residential solar. We don't sell solar panels. We don't get paid to send you to installers.

### Why this exists

The residential solar information landscape has a problem: almost every site that ranks on Google for solar questions makes money by generating leads for installers. That creates an incentive to always say yes to solar, to oversimplify the math, and to skip the situations where solar doesn't make sense.

We started SolarPilled because we wanted the resource we couldn't find when we were researching solar for our own homes. Something that treats the reader like an adult. Something that shows the math, cites the sources, and says "this might not be for you" when that's the honest answer.

### What we believe

**Data over vibes.** We cite specific numbers from named sources. When we say a system costs $2.58/W, we link to where that number comes from. When we say payback takes 12 years, we show the calculation.

**Honesty builds trust.** We publish articles about when NOT to go solar. We explain the downsides of products alongside the upsides. We think this makes us more useful, not less.

**Your situation is specific.** National averages are starting points, not answers. Your electricity rate, roof, state incentives, and financial situation determine whether solar works for you. We try to help you figure that out, not just give you a generic "yes."

**Solar is usually a good investment.** We're called SolarPilled for a reason. We think solar makes financial and environmental sense for most homeowners. But "most" isn't "all," and we respect the difference.

### How we make money

Transparency matters, so here it is:

- **Affiliate links (disclosed).** When we link to products or services, some links earn us a commission. We always disclose this. We never let affiliate relationships influence our recommendations.
- **Newsletter sponsorships.** Solar-related companies can sponsor our newsletter. Sponsors are clearly labeled. Sponsored content is never disguised as editorial.
- **Premium tools.** We're building calculators and tools that go beyond what's freely available. Some will be free. Some will be paid.

What we don't do: We don't sell your information to installers. We don't accept payment for rankings or reviews. We don't run content that exists to generate solar leads.
