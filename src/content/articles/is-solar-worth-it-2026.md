## TL;DR

Solar still makes financial sense for most US homeowners in 2026, but the math changed. The federal residential tax credit (Section 25D) was repealed by HR1, removing the 30% discount that made solar a no-brainer. Without it, payback periods stretch 2-4 years longer. Whether solar is worth it now depends more on your state incentives, electricity rates, and how you finance the system.

## Key Numbers

- **Average system cost:** $30,500 for a 12 kW system before incentives (EnergySage, Jan 2026)
- **Cost per watt:** $2.58 national average
- **Federal tax credit:** 0% for residential as of 2026 (repealed by HR1)
- **Average 25-year savings:** $37,000-$154,000 depending on location and rates
- **Typical payback period without ITC:** 9-14 years (was 6-10 with the 30% credit)

## The Landscape Shifted. Here's How.

Two years ago, this article would have been shorter. The 30% federal tax credit knocked $9,000+ off a typical system, utility rates were climbing 3-5% annually, and net metering was still the standard in most states. The answer for most homeowners was a clear yes.

In 2026, three things changed:

**1. The federal residential tax credit is gone.** HR1 repealed Section 25D, the residential clean energy credit that gave homeowners 30% back on their solar investment. Commercial solar (Section 48) still has credits with a stepped-down timeline, but if you're putting panels on your house, the federal government is no longer chipping in. More on this in our [tax credit explainer](/articles/solar-tax-credit-2026).

**2. Net metering continues to erode.** California's NEM 3.0 (now over two years old) set the template. Export rates dropped from full retail (averaging $0.30/kWh in CA) to roughly $0.05-$0.08/kWh. Arizona, Nevada, and several other states followed with similar net billing structures. In states where you get full retail credit for excess production, solar economics still look great. In net billing states, you need to self-consume more of your production or add a battery.

**3. Electricity rates kept climbing.** The national average residential rate hit $0.18/kWh in 2025, up from $0.16/kWh in 2023 (EIA data). In high-rate states like Connecticut ($0.30+/kWh), Massachusetts ($0.28+/kWh), and California ($0.32+/kWh on tiered plans), solar offsets more expensive electricity, which keeps the economics strong even without federal incentives.

## The Actual Math: Three Homeowner Scenarios

Let's run real numbers for three different situations. These use actual utility rates and system costs, not hypothetical averages.

### Scenario 1: Massachusetts Homeowner

- **Electricity rate:** $0.28/kWh
- **Annual usage:** 8,500 kWh
- **System size:** 8 kW (adequate for this usage in MA)
- **System cost:** $24,800 ($3.10/W, typical for MA's higher labor costs)
- **State incentive:** SMART program provides performance-based incentives of ~$0.06/kWh for 10 years
- **Net metering:** Full retail credit still available in MA
- **Annual electricity savings:** $2,380
- **SMART incentive (annual):** ~$480 (first 10 years)
- **Year 1 total benefit:** $2,860
- **Simple payback:** 8.7 years (without SMART: 10.4 years)
- **25-year savings:** ~$47,000 (assuming 3% annual rate increases)

**Verdict: Yes, solar is worth it.** High electricity rates and strong state policy make MA one of the best solar markets in the country, even without federal incentives.

### Scenario 2: Texas Homeowner

- **Electricity rate:** $0.14/kWh (competitive retail market, rates vary widely)
- **Annual usage:** 14,000 kWh (larger homes, more AC)
- **System size:** 12 kW
- **System cost:** $28,800 ($2.40/W, lower labor costs in TX)
- **State incentives:** None statewide. Some municipal utility rebates exist (Austin Energy offers up to $2,500)
- **Net metering:** No statewide policy. Varies by utility. Many offer avoided-cost rates (~$0.03-$0.04/kWh for exports)
- **Annual electricity savings:** $1,960 (assuming 70% self-consumption, exports at $0.04/kWh)
- **Simple payback:** 14.7 years (13.4 with Austin Energy rebate)
- **25-year savings:** ~$28,000

**Verdict: Marginal.** Low electricity rates and weak export compensation make solar a longer-term play in Texas. If your rate is above $0.16/kWh (some TX plans hit $0.18-$0.20), the math improves. If you're on a fixed-rate plan below $0.12/kWh, solar doesn't pencil out for at least 15 years.

### Scenario 3: Arizona Homeowner (NEM 3.0-style state)

- **Electricity rate:** $0.15/kWh base, but TOU peak rates hit $0.25/kWh
- **Annual usage:** 16,000 kWh (heavy AC load)
- **System size:** 13 kW
- **System cost:** $29,900 ($2.30/W, competitive AZ market)
- **State incentive:** AZ offers a $1,000 tax credit
- **Net metering:** AZ has moved to export rates of ~$0.05-$0.09/kWh depending on utility
- **With battery (13.5 kWh):** Add ~$10,500 after install. Battery shifts solar production to offset peak TOU rates.
- **Annual savings (solar only):** $1,800
- **Annual savings (solar + battery):** $2,900 (battery enables peak-rate arbitrage)
- **Payback (solar only):** 16.1 years
- **Payback (solar + battery):** 13.8 years

**Verdict: Solar alone is a tough sell. Solar plus battery makes more sense.** In TOU states with low export rates, batteries flip the economics by letting you use your own solar during expensive peak hours instead of selling it cheap to the utility.

## When Solar Is Worth It in 2026

Solar remains a strong financial decision if you check two or more of these boxes:

**High electricity rates.** If you're paying $0.20/kWh or more, solar payback periods stay under 12 years even without federal incentives. At $0.25+/kWh, payback drops below 10 years in most cases.

**Good state incentives.** Massachusetts (SMART), New York (NY-Sun), Illinois (SREC program), New Jersey (SREC-II), and Maryland (state tax credit) all offer meaningful financial support. Some of these programs offset half or more of what the federal ITC used to provide.

**Full net metering.** If your state and utility still credit you at full retail for excess production, your system produces value all day, not just during your usage hours. Check your state's current net metering policy before getting quotes.

**Rising rates.** If your utility has filed for rate increases (most have, check your state PUC docket), the value of solar increases every year. A system that saves $2,000 in year one might save $3,500 in year ten if rates climb 5% annually.

**You plan to stay put.** Solar adds home value. A Lawrence Berkeley National Lab study found solar homes sell for a premium of roughly $4/W of installed capacity. But you need 5+ years minimum to recoup transaction costs and start seeing net positive returns.

**You have good sun and roof.** South-facing roof with minimal shading in a location that gets 4+ peak sun hours daily. This is most of the continental US outside the Pacific Northwest.

## When Solar Is NOT Worth It in 2026

Here's where we diverge from every other solar site: sometimes you shouldn't go solar. Here are real situations where the math doesn't work.

**Your electricity bill is under $80/month.** If you're already efficient and your rates are low, there's not enough savings to offset the system cost in a reasonable timeframe. A $30,000 investment to save $960/year is a 31-year payback. Pass.

**You're moving within 5 years.** While solar adds home value, the premium varies by market, and you'll lose money on a financed system if you sell before the crossover point. If there's any chance you move soon, wait.

**Your roof needs replacement in the next 5 years.** Removing and reinstalling solar panels for a roof replacement costs $2,000-$5,000. If your roof is aging, replace it first, then add solar.

**Heavy shading.** If large trees or buildings shade your roof for significant parts of the day, your production drops and payback extends. Get a shade analysis (a good installer will do this with satellite imagery or a site visit). If you lose more than 20% to shading, the economics weaken fast.

**You have a very small roof.** Condos, townhomes, or homes with complex rooflines and limited south-facing area may not have room for enough panels. If you can only fit a 3-4 kW system, the fixed costs (permitting, electrical work, monitoring) eat into the value.

**Your utility rate is below $0.10/kWh.** This is rare but exists in parts of the Southeast and Pacific Northwest (hydro-heavy utilities). At these rates, a 12 kW system saves maybe $1,200/year. That's a 25-year payback with no federal credit.

## The Financing Question

Without the federal tax credit, how you pay for solar matters more than it used to.

**Cash** is the simplest and yields the best returns. No interest payments, no dealer fees. Your ROI is purely: energy savings minus system cost. If you have the capital, this is the cleanest option.

**Solar loans** are more complicated now. Many solar loans include dealer fees of 15-30% that are baked into the loan amount. On a $30,000 system, you might actually be financing $35,000-$39,000. The tax credit used to help offset these fees (homeowners would use their $9,000 refund to pay down the principal). Without it, you're carrying that inflated balance for the full term. Read the loan docs carefully.

**Leases and PPAs** are making a comeback. With no tax credit for homeowners to capture, the financial advantage of ownership shrinks. A lease or PPA from a company like Sunrun or SunPower lets you pay a fixed monthly rate for solar electricity, usually 10-20% below your utility rate. You don't own the system, you don't get tax benefits, but you also don't put up $30,000. For homeowners in high-rate states who lack the cash or credit for ownership, this is a valid path.

## The Honest Take

Solar in 2026 is a tougher sell than it was in 2024. That's just the reality of losing a 30% federal subsidy. The industry is adjusting: panel prices continue to drop, installer competition keeps labor costs in check, and state programs are stepping up in some markets.

But the fundamental value proposition hasn't changed. You're converting a recurring expense (electricity bills that increase 3-5% yearly) into a fixed asset that produces free power for 25-30 years. The question is how long it takes to break even, and whether that timeline works for your situation.

For homeowners in high-rate states with good sun and decent state incentives, solar still delivers 8-12 year payback periods and $30,000+ in lifetime savings. That's a 6-8% annual return on your investment, competitive with long-term stock market performance and far less volatile.

For homeowners in low-rate states with no state incentives, the calculus is harder. You're looking at 14-18 year payback periods. Solar will still save you money over 25 years, but you need to be comfortable with a long-horizon investment.

The right move: get 3+ quotes (EnergySage and local installers), run the numbers for your specific situation, and make the decision based on your payback period, not anyone's sales pitch, including ours.

## What to Do Next

1. **Check your electricity rate.** Look at your utility bill. Find your per-kWh rate. If it's above $0.15/kWh, keep reading. If it's above $0.20/kWh, solar almost certainly makes sense.
2. **Look up your state incentives.** DSIRE (dsireusa.org) maintains the most complete database of state and local solar incentives.
3. **Get multiple quotes.** Three minimum. Compare cost per watt, equipment specs, and warranty terms, not just the total price.
4. **Run a payback calculation.** Use our solar payback calculator (coming soon) or do the math yourself: Net Cost / Annual Savings = Payback Years.
5. **Read our [cost breakdown](/articles/solar-panel-cost-2026) and [tax credit guide](/articles/solar-tax-credit-2026)** for more detail on specific aspects of the decision.
