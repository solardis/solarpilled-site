## TL;DR

The average US residential solar installation costs $30,500 for a 12 kW system ($2.58/W) before incentives. Panels are only about 12% of that cost. The rest is inverters, racking, labor, permitting, overhead, and installer profit margin. Prices range from $2.20/W in competitive markets like Arizona to $3.20/W in higher-cost areas like New York. Here's exactly what your money buys.

## Key Numbers

- **National average cost:** $30,505 for 12 kW (EnergySage, Jan 2026)
- **Cost per watt range:** $2.20-$3.20 depending on state and system size
- **Panel cost (hardware only):** $0.30-$0.50/W (roughly 12-15% of total)
- **Inverter cost:** $0.25-$0.45/W (microinverters cost more than string inverters)
- **Installation labor:** $0.50-$0.75/W
- **Soft costs (permitting, overhead, profit):** $0.80-$1.20/W

## Why Solar Costs What It Does

When you see a $30,000 quote, it's natural to think you're mostly paying for solar panels. You're not. Panels are the cheapest part of a residential solar installation. The rest is labor, electrical equipment, permitting, overhead, and profit.

This matters because understanding the cost structure helps you evaluate quotes, negotiate effectively, and spot when you're overpaying.

Here's the breakdown for a typical 12 kW residential system at $2.58/W ($30,960 total):

| Component | Cost/Watt | Total (12 kW) | % of Total |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| Solar panels | $0.35 | $4,200 | 13.6% |
| Inverter(s) | $0.35 | $4,200 | 13.6% |
| Racking/mounting | $0.15 | $1,800 | 5.8% |
| Balance of system (wiring, disconnects, monitoring) | $0.18 | $2,160 | 7.0% |
| Installation labor | $0.60 | $7,200 | 23.2% |
| Permitting and interconnection | $0.15 | $1,800 | 5.8% |
| Customer acquisition | $0.25 | $3,000 | 9.7% |
| Overhead and profit | $0.55 | $6,600 | 21.3% |
| **Total** | **$2.58** | **$30,960** | **100%** |

Let's dig into each component.

## Solar Panels: $0.30-$0.50/W

Solar panels themselves are cheap. A standard 400W monocrystalline panel costs $120-$200 at wholesale. Premium panels (REC Alpha Pure, SunPower Maxeon 7, Panasonic EverVolt) run $200-$350 per panel.

For a 12 kW system, you need about 27-30 panels (depending on wattage per panel).

**What affects panel cost:**

- **Efficiency.** Standard panels run 20-21% efficient. Premium panels hit 22-24%. Higher efficiency means fewer panels for the same output, which can matter on space-constrained roofs.
- **Country of origin.** Panels manufactured in Southeast Asia are cheapest. US-manufactured panels (from the new factories SEIA tracks at 60+ GW capacity) cost more but may qualify for domestic content bonuses on commercial systems.
- **Tariffs.** The tariff situation changes frequently. As of early 2026, anti-dumping duties and Section 201 tariffs add $0.05-$0.15/W to imported panels depending on country of origin. Chinese-made panels face the steepest duties.
- **Brand premium.** SunPower, REC, and Panasonic charge more because they offer longer warranties (25 years on both product and performance) and lower degradation rates (0.25-0.3% per year vs. 0.4-0.5% for standard panels).

**The honest take on panels:** For most homeowners, mid-tier panels from manufacturers like Canadian Solar, Qcells, Trina, or JA Solar deliver 95% of the performance of premium panels at 60-70% of the price. The efficiency difference between a 21% panel and a 23% panel is about 2 fewer panels on your roof. Unless you're severely space-constrained, it rarely justifies the premium.

## Inverters: $0.25-$0.45/W

The inverter converts DC electricity from your panels to AC electricity your home uses. There are three types, and the choice affects your cost, performance, and monitoring capabilities.

| Type | Cost/W | Pros | Cons |
|------|--------|------|------|
| String inverter | $0.25-$0.30 | Lowest cost, simple design, easy to replace | Single point of failure, shade affects entire string |
| Power optimizers + string inverter | $0.30-$0.40 | Panel-level optimization, better shade performance | More components, moderate cost |
| Microinverters | $0.35-$0.45 | Panel-level optimization, no single point of failure, panel-level monitoring | Highest cost, more components on roof |

**Market context:** Enphase dominates the US microinverter market. SolarEdge is the leading optimizer + string inverter provider, though the company went through financial difficulties in 2024-2025 that raised warranty concerns among some installers. SMA and other string inverter manufacturers serve the budget-conscious segment.

**What matters:** If your roof has partial shading or multiple orientations (panels facing different directions), microinverters or optimizers are worth the premium. If your roof is a clean south-facing rectangle with no shade, a string inverter saves you $1,200-$2,400 on a 12 kW system with minimal production difference.

## Racking and Mounting: $0.12-$0.20/W

Racking is the aluminum rail system that attaches panels to your roof. Standard roof-mount racking is a commodity product and shouldn't be a major cost driver.

**What can increase racking costs:**
- **Tile roofs:** Require specialized tile hooks and more careful installation. Add $0.05-$0.10/W.
- **Flat roofs:** Need ballasted or tilt-up racking to angle panels. Add $0.03-$0.08/W.
- **Ground mounts:** Significantly more expensive due to trenching, concrete footings, and additional racking. Add $0.30-$0.60/W over standard roof mount.
- **Metal roofs:** Standing seam metal roofs are actually the easiest to install on (clamp-on mounts, no roof penetrations). Can reduce racking costs slightly.

## Installation Labor: $0.50-$0.75/W

Labor is the second-largest cost component. A typical residential installation takes a crew of 3-4 workers one to three days depending on system size and complexity.

**What drives labor costs:**
- **Regional wages.** Electricians and roofers in California, New York, and Massachusetts cost more than in Texas or Florida. This is the primary reason cost-per-watt varies by state.
- **Roof complexity.** A single-plane, easily accessible roof takes less time. Multi-level homes, steep pitches (over 8/12), or roofs requiring scaffolding increase labor hours.
- **Electrical panel upgrades.** If your home's electrical panel is older (100A service) or full, upgrading to a 200A panel adds $1,500-$3,000 to the project. This is increasingly common as homes add EV chargers and heat pumps alongside solar.
- **Permit requirements.** Some jurisdictions require licensed electricians for all wiring work. Others allow solar-specific licensed installers. Labor rates differ.

## The Soft Costs: Where the Money Really Goes

Here's the part most cost breakdowns skip. Soft costs (customer acquisition, permitting, overhead, profit) represent over 35% of a residential solar installation. This is the area with the most variability between installers and the most room for negotiation.

### Customer Acquisition: $0.20-$0.35/W

It costs money to find you. Solar companies spend on:
- Digital advertising ($2,000-$5,000 per customer for online leads)
- Sales team compensation (commissions of $1,000-$3,000 per deal)
- Door-to-door sales crews (the most expensive channel, often $3,000-$5,000 per sale)
- Lead purchasing from platforms like EnergySage, SolarReviews, etc.

This is why door-knocker companies like Vivint Solar (now Sunrun) tend to be more expensive. Their customer acquisition cost is higher, and it shows up in your price.

**How to pay less for this:** Go direct. Find local installers through recommendations, contractor directories, or solar installer maps. When you contact an installer directly (instead of them finding you through paid advertising), they save $2,000-$4,000 in acquisition costs. Some pass that savings to you.

### Permitting and Interconnection: $0.10-$0.20/W

Every solar installation requires permits (building, electrical) and utility interconnection approval. Costs include:
- Permit fees ($200-$1,000 depending on jurisdiction)
- Plan sets and engineering stamps ($300-$800)
- Utility interconnection application (usually free but requires staff time)
- Inspections (included in permit fees in most areas)

This process takes 2-8 weeks in most jurisdictions. Some cities (looking at you, San Jose) are notoriously slow, which adds to project overhead.

### Overhead and Profit: $0.45-$0.65/W

This includes the installer's office costs, insurance, vehicles, warranties, and profit margin. Typical installer gross margins run 15-25% on residential projects.

This is not a criticism. Installers take on real risk (warranty obligations for 25 years, workmanship guarantees, roof penetration liability) and need sustainable margins to stay in business. An installer offering suspiciously low prices may not be around in 5 years when you need warranty service.

## Cost by State: Where You Fall

| State | Avg $/W | 12 kW System Cost | Main Cost Driver |
|-------|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Arizona | $2.30 | $27,600 | Competitive market, high volume |
| California | $2.75 | $33,000 | High labor costs, complex permitting |
| Colorado | $2.65 | $31,800 | Moderate costs across the board |
| Florida | $2.45 | $29,400 | Growing market, moderate labor |
| Massachusetts | $3.10 | $37,200 | High labor, complex regulations |
| New Jersey | $2.70 | $32,400 | Dense market, moderate costs |
| New York | $3.00 | $36,000 | High labor, extensive permitting |
| North Carolina | $2.50 | $30,000 | Growing market, moderate costs |
| Texas | $2.40 | $28,800 | Low labor costs, minimal regulation |
| Washington | $2.65 | $31,800 | Moderate costs, less competition |

## How to Lower Your Cost

**1. Get at least three quotes.** This is the single most effective way to get a fair price. EnergySage data shows homeowners who compare 3+ quotes save 10-20% over single-quote buyers.

**2. Consider smaller, local installers.** National companies (Sunrun, ADT Solar) spend more on marketing and have higher overhead. Local installers often offer the same equipment at $0.20-$0.40/W less.

**3. Be flexible on equipment.** If your installer offers a choice between REC Alpha and Qcells panels, the Qcells panels might save $1,500 with minimal performance difference. Same for string inverters vs. microinverters on unshaded roofs.

**4. Time your purchase.** Q4 and Q1 are typically slower seasons for installers. Some offer discounts to keep crews busy during winter months.

**5. Check for local incentives.** Municipal rebates, utility programs, and state tax credits vary widely. DSIRE (dsireusa.org) lists them all. Some are substantial: New York's NY-Sun program offers $0.20/W+, Illinois SRECs are worth $3,000-$5,000 over 5 years.

**6. Avoid dealer-fee-heavy loans.** If financing, ask the installer about dealer fees. A "0% interest" solar loan often hides 20-30% in fees added to the principal. A standard 5-6% interest loan with no dealer fees frequently costs less over the life of the loan.

## What a Good Quote Looks Like

When you get a solar quote, here's what to look for:

**Itemized costs.** A quality installer breaks down equipment, labor, permitting, and other costs separately. If the quote is just a single number, ask for the breakdown.

**Equipment specs listed.** Panel manufacturer and model, inverter type and model, racking system. You should know exactly what's going on your roof.

**Production estimate with methodology.** How many kWh will this system produce? Good installers use satellite imagery and modeling software (Aurora, Helioscope) to estimate production based on your specific roof, shading, and orientation. Be skeptical of round numbers or overly optimistic estimates.

**Warranty terms.** Panel warranty (should be 25 years product, 25-30 years performance), inverter warranty (12-25 years), workmanship warranty (10-25 years, this one varies a lot).

**Price per watt.** This is the standard comparison metric. If an installer quotes you $3.50/W in Arizona, they're above market. If they quote $2.30/W in Massachusetts, ask what corners they're cutting.

## The Honest Take

Solar panel costs have dropped 90%+ since 2010. The hardware is cheap. What you're really paying for in 2026 is installation, permitting, and the business infrastructure required to design, build, and warranty a system on your roof.

The loss of the federal tax credit means your out-of-pocket cost is higher than it would have been a year ago. But panel and inverter prices continue to fall, installer competition keeps pressure on margins, and state incentives partially fill the gap in many markets.

The biggest factor in what you'll pay is how many quotes you get. Homeowners who get one quote from a door-knocker pay the most. Homeowners who compare three or more quotes from competitive installers pay the least. The difference can be $5,000-$10,000 on the same system.

Don't overpay for solar. But don't chase the absolute lowest price either. A quality installation from a financially stable company with strong warranties is worth a small premium over a fly-by-night installer who might not exist when you need service in year 8.
