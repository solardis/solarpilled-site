## The Short Answer

For most homeowners in 2026: **not yet, purely on economics.** But the calculus is shifting fast, and there are non-financial reasons that might tip the scales.

## The Cost Reality

A typical home battery system (like a Tesla Powerwall or Enphase IQ) runs $10,000–$15,000 installed for 10-13 kWh of usable capacity. That's enough to cover an average home's evening usage for one night.

The 30% federal tax credit applies, bringing the net cost to $7,000–$10,500. But that's still a lot of money for what amounts to a few hours of backup power.

## When Batteries Make Financial Sense

### 1. Time-of-Use Rate Arbitrage
If your utility charges significantly more during peak hours (evenings) than off-peak (midday), a battery lets you store cheap solar power and use it during expensive hours. The bigger the spread, the better the math.

**Break-even scenario:** Peak/off-peak spread of $0.20+/kWh, daily cycling, 10-year battery warranty.

### 2. Poor Net Metering
If your utility pays you peanuts for exported solar (looking at you, California NEM 3.0), storing that power for self-consumption is worth more than sending it to the grid.

### 3. Demand Charge Reduction
Some utilities charge based on your peak demand, not just total usage. Batteries can shave these peaks.

## When Batteries Don't Make Sense

- **Full retail net metering:** The grid is basically a free battery. Use it.
- **Flat-rate electricity:** No arbitrage opportunity.
- **Backup power only:** A generator is 90% cheaper if that's all you want.

## The Non-Financial Case

Power outages, energy independence, reduced grid dependence — these have real value that doesn't show up in a spreadsheet. If you live in an area with unreliable grid power, a battery might be worth it for peace of mind alone.

Just don't let an installer tell you it "pays for itself." Run the numbers.
