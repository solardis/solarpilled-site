## The Number Everyone Gets Wrong

You've heard the pitch: "Solar pays for itself in 7-10 years!" Maybe. But that number is doing a lot of heavy lifting, and it depends on variables most installers gloss over.

Let's break down the actual math.

## What Goes Into a Payback Calculation

The core formula is deceptively simple:

**Payback Period = Net System Cost / Annual Electricity Savings**

But each of those terms hides complexity.

### Net System Cost

Your gross cost minus incentives. In 2026, the federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) covers 30% of system costs. Some states add their own incentives on top.

- **Gross cost:** Typically $2.50–$3.50/watt installed
- **Federal ITC (30%):** Reduces your tax liability dollar-for-dollar
- **State/local incentives:** Varies wildly — $0 in some states, thousands in others

For a typical 8kW system at $3.00/watt:
- Gross: $24,000
- After federal ITC: $16,800
- After state incentives: Depends on where you live

### Annual Electricity Savings

This is where most estimates get sloppy. You need:

1. **Your actual electricity rate** (not the national average)
2. **Your system's expected production** (based on your roof, not a brochure)
3. **Your utility's net metering policy** (this is the big one)

## Why Net Metering Changes Everything

If your utility offers full retail net metering, every kWh you export is worth your full retail rate. If they've moved to net billing or time-of-use export rates, your exported power might be worth 30-60% less.

This single factor can swing your payback period by 3-5 years.

## The Honest Answer

For most homeowners with decent sun exposure, reasonable electricity rates (>$0.15/kWh), and full net metering: **6-9 years** is realistic.

Without net metering? With low electricity rates? **10-15 years** — and you should seriously consider whether the economics alone justify the investment.

Solar can still make sense for non-financial reasons. But you deserve honest numbers.

We're working on a calculator that uses your actual utility rate, local solar irradiance data, and real incentive databases to give you a number you can trust. Stay tuned.
